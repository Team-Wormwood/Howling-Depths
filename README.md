> ## | Project Overview
   **Howling Depths** is an upcoming Minecraft Add-On that twists the underground landscape into a horrifying new hell. Discover new, mysterious locations both above and below the ground in a constant fight for survival. Perform powerful rituals, or fight to stop those that do. Fight monsters, become stronger - fear caves again ! 

> ## | Project Goals
- Implement many rare and obscure religious/mythological ideas and concepts and tie them together as toâ€¦
- Create and maintain a high-quality and consistent experience in all mediums, including but not limited to: artistic, gameplay, thematic, and - above all - unique.
- Remain maintained and expanded by both team and community members for as long as is (reasonably) possible.

### **I**. The project is to be namespaced "sakana:" universally.
- Entity, Block, and Item Events are to namespaced with the name of the object, followed by a camelCase event name.
### **II**. Pull Requests may be made to the project GitHub, and are greatly encouraged, but all content is to be reviewed, edited, and revised by Yana personally.
### **III**. All artistic elements are to be made in a style relatively in the style of Minecraft.
### **IV**. All code should be neatly formatted and indented to a tab-size of 4.
- Folder structure is, similarly, to be neat and organised.
### **V**. No code - under any circumstances, whatsoever - shall absolutely ever be obfuscated.
### **VI**. When taking inspiration from other's projects, deviate as much as possible; this is in efforts to achieve a unique experience, and should be highly valued.
